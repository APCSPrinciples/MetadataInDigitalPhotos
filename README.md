With a partner, take a photo and examine it's metadata
------------------------------------------------------

Take a photo with you or your partner’s smartphone and open it with an online metadata viewer like http://metapicz.com or http://exif.regex.info. You may want to email yourself the photo so that you can open it on the school computer. Find the following metadata in your photo.
+ Camera	
+ Date	
+ Location	

Now, open that same photo in HxD. Are you able to find the metadata you just recorded?

Solve two hacking competition problems
--------------------------------------

Hacking competitions sometimes include digital photos. One hacking competition had the photograph on the right with the clue “My friend sends me pictures before every ctf. He told me this one was special.” Can you find the secret flag that was hidden in the metadata of the photo? You can view the original photo online at this link. Download [the photo](https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2015/blob/master/csaw-ctf-2015/forensics/keep-calm-and-ctf-100/img.jpg) and use HxD or an online metadata viewer to find the secret flag. Record the secret flag.

Here’s another photo from a hacking competition. Download the original photo at [this link](https://mega.nz/#!QDZGiLSZ!fkkhBJuBBtBKGsLTDiF2NuLihP2WRd97Iynd3PhWqRw), then use HxD or an online metadata viewer to find the secret flag. Record the secret flag.

The [Stolen Camera Finder](http://www.stolencamerafinder.com/) uses the metadata from a photograph to find if any other photographs from the same camera were posted on the web.
